# Happy Holidays bootloader

x86 boot-sector program that shows a rainbow-coloured "Joyeux NoÃ«l" ("Happy Holidays" in French) message on the screen.
Technically it's a boot sector + another for some of the graphics, as even compressed they wouldn't fit in a single sector.

Assembly:

```console
nasm -f bin boot.asm -o boot.bin
```

Running (in QEMU):

```console
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=boot.bin
```

You can also totally flash this to a USB drive and boot from it on bare metal and it should work.
You just need to make sure CSM is enabled on UEFI-only systems.

Calling this "Happy Holidays" instead of "Merry Christmas" because apparently "Happy Holidays" is "woke" and there's this war on Christmas apparently and I don't know exactly what  the deal is but some losers get triggered by this and I think it's funny.
